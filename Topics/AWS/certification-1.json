    "question": "Which AWS service is best suited for storing and retrieving any amount of unstructured data (such as images and backups) with high durability and scalability?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Amazon EBS",
      "B": "Amazon S3",
      "C": "Amazon RDS",
      "D": "Amazon EFS",
      "E": "Amazon DynamoDB"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Option B (Amazon S3) is correct because S3 is an object storage service designed for virtually unlimited scalability and very high durability (11 nines), making it ideal for unstructured data such as media files, logs, and backups. Option A (Amazon EBS) is incorrect because EBS provides block storage for EC2 instances, is volume-bound, and is optimized for low-latency, transactional workloads rather than large-scale object storage or web-scale access. Option C (Amazon RDS) is incorrect because RDS is a managed relational database for structured, relational data and is not intended to store large binary objects like images or backups. Option D (Amazon EFS) is incorrect because EFS is a scalable, managed NFS file system for Linux workloads requiring shared file access and POSIX semantics; it is not object storage and is less suited for web-scale object retrieval compared to S3. Option E (Amazon DynamoDB) is incorrect because DynamoDB is a NoSQL key–value and document database optimized for millisecond latency on small items; it is not designed to store large binary objects (items are size-limited) and is typically used alongside S3 for object storage."

      "C": "Amazon ECS on EC2",
      "D": "AWS Elastic Beanstalk",
      "E": "Amazon EKS"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Option B (AWS Lambda) is correct because Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs your code in response to events and scales automatically. Option A (Amazon EC2) requires you to provision and manage instances. Option C (Amazon ECS on EC2) still requires managing the underlying EC2 instances. Option D (Elastic Beanstalk) simplifies deployments but still provisions infrastructure under the hood. Option E (Amazon EKS) manages Kubernetes control planes, but you still manage worker capacity unless using Fargate."

      "C": "Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)",
      "D": "Amazon CloudFront",
      "E": "Amazon API Gateway"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Option C (Elastic Load Balancing) is correct because ELB balances incoming traffic across targets and AZs to improve availability and fault tolerance. Option A (Route 53) is DNS and does not load balance within a VPC. Option B (Global Accelerator) optimizes path over the AWS global network but is not a substitute for load balancing within a Region. Option D (CloudFront) is a CDN for cached/static and dynamic content delivery. Option E (API Gateway) provides managed API endpoints, not in-VPC traffic load balancing."

      "C": "AWS Global Accelerator",
      "D": "Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration",
      "E": "AWS Direct Connect"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Option B (Amazon CloudFront) is correct because CloudFront is AWS's content delivery network (CDN) that caches content at edge locations to reduce latency. Option A (Route 53) is a scalable DNS service. Option C (Global Accelerator) accelerates TCP/UDP traffic to your applications but does not cache content. Option D (S3 Transfer Acceleration) speeds up S3 uploads/downloads using edge locations but is not a CDN for arbitrary origins. Option E (Direct Connect) provides dedicated network links; it is not for content delivery."

      "E": "VPC endpoint policy"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Option C (IAM role attached to the EC2 instance) is correct because instance profiles provide temporary credentials automatically rotated by AWS STS. Option A is insecure and violates best practices. Option B (resource-based policy) controls access but still requires a principal identity/credentials. Option D (KMS) manages encryption keys, not identity. Option E (VPC endpoint policy) scopes traffic but is not a substitute for identity/credentials."

      "E": "S3 Glacier Deep Archive"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Option B (S3 Standard-IA) is correct because it offers lower storage cost for infrequently accessed data with millisecond retrieval and multi-AZ redundancy. Option A (Standard) is for frequently accessed data. Option C (One Zone-IA) stores data in a single AZ (lower resilience). Option D (Glacier Instant Retrieval) is for archival objects accessed rarely; while it offers milliseconds retrieval, it targets archival patterns and may not be the best fit versus Standard-IA for general infrequent access. Option E (Deep Archive) has hours of retrieval latency."

    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Option C (Compute Savings Plans) is correct because they apply to any EC2 instance regardless of family, Region, OS, tenancy, and also to Fargate and Lambda, offering broad flexibility with discounted rates. Option A (Standard RIs) and Option B (Convertible RIs) provide discounts but with more constraints (specific instance or convertible within families). Option D (EC2 Instance Savings Plans) are tied to a specific instance family in a Region. Option E (Spot) can be the cheapest but is interruption-prone and not a commitment-based discount program."
