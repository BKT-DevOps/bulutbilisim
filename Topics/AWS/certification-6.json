    "question": "Which AWS support plan includes access to Technical Account Managers (TAMs), proactive reviews, and a concierge billing team?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Basic",
      "B": "Developer",
      "C": "Business",
      "D": "Enterprise On-Ramp",
      "E": "Enterprise"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "E",
    "explanation": "The Enterprise Support plan provides a TAM, concierge billing, and proactive guidance. Basic (A) and Developer (B) do not. Business (C) adds 24/7 support but no dedicated TAM. Enterprise On-Ramp (D) offers guidance but not the full Enterprise benefits including a dedicated TAM."

    "question": "Which feature helps allocate AWS costs by letting you apply metadata to resources and then report by that metadata in Cost Explorer?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Resource Groups",
      "B": "Cost Allocation Tags",
      "C": "AWS Budgets",
      "D": "AWS Billing Conductor",
      "E": "AWS Organizations"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Cost allocation tags (user-defined or AWS-generated) enable grouping and reporting in billing and Cost Explorer. Resource Groups (A) organize resources but not costs. Budgets (C) sets alerts. Billing Conductor (D) customizes chargeback/showback. Organizations (E) manages accounts, not per-resource cost metadata."

      "C": "AWS Trusted Advisor",
      "D": "AWS Billing Console",
      "E": "AWS CloudTrail"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "AWS Budgets Actions let you trigger automated responses (e.g., EC2 stop, IAM policy changes) when cost/usage thresholds are met. Cost Explorer (B) analyzes costs. Trusted Advisor (C) provides checks, not automated budget actions. Billing Console (D) is the UI. CloudTrail (E) audits API calls."

      "C": "Amazon S3",
      "D": "Amazon EFS",
      "E": "FSx for Lustre"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Instance store is ephemeral block storage physically attached to the host; data is lost when the instance stops or terminates. EBS (A) is persistent. S3 (C) is object storage. EFS (D) is NFS file storage. FSx (E) is managed file systems."

      "E": "VPC peering"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "You can add launch permissions to an AMI for specific AWS account IDs. Public launch permission (A) makes it available to all. S3 policy (C) is unrelated. RAM (D) shares certain resource types (e.g., subnets), not AMIs. VPC peering (E) is networking."

      "C": "S3 Transfer Acceleration",
      "D": "S3 Replication",
      "E": "S3 Requester Pays"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "CloudFront OAI/OAC allows CloudFront to access the bucket while blocking public access to S3. Public ACL (B) exposes data. Transfer Acceleration (C) speeds transfers. Replication (D) copies objects. Requester Pays (E) shifts data transfer cost to downloaders."

      "C": "Function memory size",
      "D": "Environment variables",
      "E": "Layers"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Reserved concurrency sets a hard cap for a function and guarantees that amount is available. Provisioned Concurrency (A) keeps functions warm for lower latency but doesn’t cap overall account usage. Memory size (C), env vars (D), and Layers (E) are unrelated to concurrency limits."

      "B": "A",
      "C": "AAAA",
      "D": "Alias",
      "E": "TXT"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Alias records provide a Route 53-specific mapping to AWS resources (ALB, CloudFront, S3 website), resolving to the appropriate IPs and avoiding additional query charges. CNAME (A) cannot be used at the zone apex. A (B)/AAAA (C) require IPs. TXT (E) stores text."

      "E": "Direct Connect"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "VPC Peering connects two VPCs in a non-transitive manner; routes do not propagate through a third VPC. Transit Gateway (B) enables scalable, transitive connectivity. VPC Lattice (C) is for service-to-service networking. VPN CloudHub (D) is a hub for VPNs. Direct Connect (E) is private connectivity to AWS."

    "question": "Compared to NAT Gateways, which statement is TRUE about NAT Instances?",
    "options": {
      "A": "They are fully managed and scale automatically",
      "B": "They require manual maintenance and can be a single point of failure",

      "D": "They are cheaper and offer the same availability",
      "E": "They do not require security groups"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "NAT Instances are self-managed EC2 instances that require patching, scaling, and HA configuration; they can be a single point of failure if not architected properly. NAT Gateways are managed, highly available within an AZ. IPv6 egress (C) requires egress-only Internet Gateway. Security groups (E) apply."

      "E": "CDK Constructs"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "CloudFormation StackSets enable deploying stacks to multiple accounts and Regions centrally. Change Sets (A) preview changes. Nested Stacks (B) structure templates. Drift Detection (D) identifies configuration differences. CDK (E) is a higher-level IaC framework."

    },
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "AWS App Mesh is a service mesh that standardizes service-to-service communication across microservices with routing, retries, and metrics. API Gateway (B) exposes APIs to clients. X-Ray (C) traces but is not a mesh. CloudFront (D) is CDN. Shield (E) protects against DDoS."

    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "KMS supports automatic annual rotation for eligible customer managed symmetric keys. Grants (A) delegate access. Aliases (B) provide friendly names. Envelope encryption (D) uses data keys and a CMK. Cross-account sharing (E) requires key policy and grants, not a rotation feature."

      "E": "Use custom AMIs"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "IMDSv2 (Instance Metadata Service v2) requires session-based requests with hop-limit, mitigating SSRF and credential theft risks. Disabling encryption (B) is insecure. Opening SSH to the world (C) is insecure. Storage choices (D) and custom AMIs (E) are unrelated to metadata security."
