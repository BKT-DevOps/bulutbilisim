    "question": "Which service allows IT administrators to curate approved products (templates, AMIs, CloudFormation stacks) so end users can self-serve deployments in a governed way?",
    "options": {
      "A": "AWS Service Catalog",
      "B": "AWS CodePipeline",
      "C": "AWS Control Tower",
      "D": "AWS Marketplace",
      "E": "AWS Systems Manager"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "AWS Service Catalog lets organizations define and manage portfolios of approved products (e.g., CloudFormation templates, AMIs) so users can provision resources in a controlled, compliant manner. CodePipeline (B) is CI/CD. Control Tower (C) sets up/ governs multi-account landing zones. Marketplace (D) is a software catalog from third parties. Systems Manager (E) is for operations and automation, not curated end-user product catalogs."

      "C": "AWS Config",
      "D": "AWS CloudFormation",
      "E": "AWS Trusted Advisor"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "AWS Control Tower automates the setup of a multi-account landing zone with prescriptive guardrails, account vending, and baseline configurations using AWS Organizations under the hood. Organizations (B) is the foundational service for multi-account management but doesn't provide the turnkey landing zone. Config (C) tracks configurations. CloudFormation (D) is IaC.

    "question": "Which statement best describes an IAM identity-based policy?",
    "options": {
      "A": "A policy attached to an AWS resource that specifies who can access it",
      "B": "A policy attached to users, groups, or roles that defines what actions they can perform",
      "C": "A policy that encrypts data in transit",
      "D": "A policy that enforces network-level access via Security Groups",
      "E": "A policy that restricts permissions across multiple accounts"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Identity-based policies are attached to IAM users, groups, or roles to specify allowed/denied actions on resources. Resource-based policies (A) attach to resources (e.g., S3 bucket policy). Option C refers to TLS. Option D describes network controls. Option E describes Service Control Policies (SCPs) in AWS Organizations."

    "question": "Your team in Account A needs to access an S3 bucket in Account B without sharing long-term credentials. Which approach follows AWS best practices?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Create an IAM user in Account B and share access keys",
      "B": "Use AWS STS to assume a role in Account B and grant access via a bucket policy",
      "C": "Make the bucket public temporarily",
      "D": "Whitelist Account A's IPs in a bucket ACL",
      "E": "Copy data to a public S3 bucket and restrict by prefix"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Cross-account access is best achieved by configuring a role in Account B that Account A principals can assume using AWS STS, with the S3 bucket policy permitting the role. Sharing long-term access keys (A) is insecure. Making the bucket public (C) is not recommended. Bucket ACL IP whitelisting (D) is not how S3 ACLs work. Option E exposes data unnecessarily."
