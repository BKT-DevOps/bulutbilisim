    "question": "Which S3 storage class automatically monitors access patterns and moves objects to the most cost‑effective tier without performance impact?",
    "options": {
      "A": "S3 Standard",
      "B": "S3 Standard‑IA",
      "C": "S3 Intelligent‑Tiering",
      "D": "S3 One Zone‑IA",
      "E": "S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "S3 Intelligent‑Tiering automatically optimizes costs by moving objects between frequent and infrequent access tiers based on actual usage, with millisecond retrieval. Standard (A) and Standard‑IA (B) are fixed classes. One Zone‑IA (D) stores in a single AZ. Glacier Flexible Retrieval (E) is archival with minutes‑to‑hours retrieval."

      "E": "EFS Provisioned Throughput"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "EFS Lifecycle Management automatically transitions files to the EFS Infrequent Access (IA) storage class after a set period of inactivity. EBS snapshots (B) and S3 lifecycle (D) are for different services. FSx deduplication (C) applies to certain FSx offerings. Provisioned throughput (E) relates to performance, not tiering."

      "C": "AWS X‑Ray",
      "D": "AWS Config",
      "E": "AWS Global Accelerator"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "CloudWatch Synthetics canaries run scripted checks against endpoints from various locations and alert on failures. Route 53 health checks (B) monitor endpoints but do not run scripted user journeys. X‑Ray (C) traces requests inside applications. Config (D) checks resource configurations. Global Accelerator (E) optimizes routing, not synthetic testing."

    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "S3 provides strong read‑after‑write consistency for new objects and strong consistency for overwrite and delete operations across all Regions. Eventual consistency (A) is outdated. Options C, D, and E incorrectly limit consistency to certain contexts."

    },
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "AWS RAM allows you to securely share supported resources (e.g., subnets, Route 53 Resolver rules) across accounts. Organizations (B) provides account governance, not resource sharing. Control Tower (C) sets up landing zones. Service Catalog (D) curates products. StackSets (E) deploys stacks across accounts/Regions."

      "E": "Transit Gateway"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "An Egress‑Only Internet Gateway provides outbound‑only internet access for IPv6 traffic from private subnets. Internet Gateway (A) enables bidirectional for public subnets. NAT Gateway (B) is for IPv4. Peering (D) and Transit Gateway (E) connect networks, not direct internet egress."
