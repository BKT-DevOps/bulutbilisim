    "question": "Which AWS service lets you define and provision infrastructure as code using templates (YAML/JSON) to consistently deploy resources?",
    "options": {
      "A": "AWS CloudFormation",
      "B": "AWS Systems Manager",
      "C": "AWS OpsWorks",
      "D": "AWS Elastic Beanstalk",
      "E": "AWS CodeDeploy"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "AWS CloudFormation is the native IaC service that models, provisions, and updates AWS resources via declarative templates. Systems Manager (B) is for operations/automation. OpsWorks (C) manages Chef/Puppet stacks but is not the primary IaC service. Elastic Beanstalk (D) simplifies app deployment but abstracts infrastructure. CodeDeploy (E) automates application deployments, not full-stack resource provisioning."

      "C": "EC2 Auto Scaling",
      "D": "AWS Global Accelerator",
      "E": "AWS Backup"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "EC2 Auto Scaling adds or removes instances according to scaling policies and CloudWatch alarms to match demand. ELB (A) distributes traffic but does not change capacity. CloudWatch (B) provides metrics/alarms. Global Accelerator (D) optimizes network paths, not capacity. AWS Backup (E) centralizes backup, unrelated to scaling."

      "C": "AWS Secrets Manager",
      "D": "AWS Directory Service",
      "E": "Amazon API Gateway"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Amazon Cognito provides user pools (authentication) and identity pools (federation) with OAuth/OIDC, hosted UI, MFA, and token management. IAM (A) manages AWS principals and permissions, not end-user auth. Secrets Manager (C) stores secrets. Directory Service (D) integrates with Microsoft AD but is not a mobile auth solution. API Gateway (E) manages APIs, not identity stores."

    },
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Storage Gateway Tape Gateway exposes a virtual tape library to on-prem backup apps, writing into S3 and archiving to Glacier classes. Snowball (B) is physical data transfer. AWS Backup (C) orchestrates backups of AWS resources. S3 Glacier Deep Archive (D) is a storage class, not a VTL. DataSync (E) accelerates file transfers, not VTL integration."

      "C": "AWS Direct Connect",
      "D": "Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration",
      "E": "AWS Snowmobile"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "AWS Snowball is a rugged, secure appliance for offline data transfer at multi-terabyte scale. DataSync (A) accelerates network transfers. Direct Connect (C) is a dedicated network link, not offline. S3 Transfer Acceleration (D) speeds internet transfers. Snowmobile (E) is for exabyte-scale migrations (data center-sized), overkill for dozens of TB."

      "D": "Latency-based routing",
      "E": "Multivalue answer routing"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Latency-based routing sends users to the Region where latency is lowest. Weighted (A) splits traffic by configured weights. Failover (B) shifts to healthy secondary endpoints. Geolocation (C) routes by user's location. Multivalue answer (E) returns multiple records for simple availability improvements but isn't latency-aware."

      "C": "Automated backups",
      "D": "Database snapshots",
      "E": "Aurora Global Database"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "Read Replicas provide read-only copies with asynchronous replication to scale read workloads. Multi-AZ (A) is for high availability with synchronous replication. Automated backups (C) and snapshots (D) are for restore. Aurora Global Database (E) spans Regions for low-latency reads and DR, but the general RDS feature for read scaling is Read Replicas."

      "D": "Amazon Redshift",
      "E": "AWS Lake Formation"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "AWS Glue offers a central Data Catalog and serverless ETL jobs. Athena (B) queries data in S3 using SQL. EMR (C) runs big data frameworks. Redshift (D) is a data warehouse. Lake Formation (E) simplifies building/ securing data lakes, often using Glue underneath, but Glue is the ETL/catalog service."

    "correctAnswer": "A",
    "explanation": "Elastic Beanstalk orchestrates resources (like EC2, ELB, Auto Scaling) for application deployments with managed health monitoring. CodePipeline (B) is CI/CD orchestration. App Runner (C) runs containerized/web apps serverlessly but abstracts resources; Beanstalk targets broader app stacks. Lightsail (D) is simplified VPS.

      "E": "Data Centers"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Edge locations support Amazon CloudFront and Lambda@Edge for low-latency delivery. Availability Zones (A) are isolated locations within Regions for compute/storage. Local Zones (B) extend AWS closer to metro areas for low-latency compute. Wavelength Zones (C) embed compute at telecom 5G networks. 'Data centers' (E) is a generic term, not the AWS construct."
